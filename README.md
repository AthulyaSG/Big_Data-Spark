## Application of PySpark in the Stock Market
### Stock Market
* The process of buying and selling stocks involves transactions in the stock market
* Companies secure capital in the stock market through the sale of shares, or equity, to investors
* A stock signifies ownership in a company or organization, entailing a proportional stake in its assets and earnings
* Stock exchanges serve as secondary markets where shareholders can engage in transactions (Hayes, 2023)
## PySpark
* To facilitate the integration of Spark and Python
* The Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing framework and collection of libraries for processing massive amounts of data in real-time
* PySpark not only offers an API for Spark but also aids in connecting with Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)
* Contrast between Pandas and Spark dataframes lies in their execution
* In PySpark, operations are postponed until they are specifically requested in the pipeline (PySpark, n.d.)
